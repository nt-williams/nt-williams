## ðŸ“Œ About Me  
I am a Senior Data Analyst at Columbia University, where I work on both methodological and application side causal inference. My work involves developing and maintaining research software for novel causal estimators.

I am particularly interested in:
- **Nonparametric Causal Inference**  
- **The Intersection of Machine Learning and Statistics**  
- **Design Focused Open Source Statistical Software**  

## ðŸ”§ Selected Software & Projects  
- **[lmtp](https://github.com/nt-williams/lmtp)** â€“ An R package that provides an estimation framework for the casual effects of feasible interventions based on point-treatment and longitudinal modified treatment policies.
- **[mlr3superlearner](https://github.com/nt-williams/mlr3superlearner)** â€“ A modern implementation of the Super Learner prediction algorithm using the mlr3 framework.
- **[crumble](https://github.com/nt-williams/crumble)** â€“ An R package for general targeted machine learning for modern causal mediation analysis.
- **[ife](https://github.com/nt-williams/ife)** - S7 class (with Ops) for influence function based estimands.
- **[codebreak](https://github.com/nt-williams/codebreak)** - A light weight codebook framework for R.
